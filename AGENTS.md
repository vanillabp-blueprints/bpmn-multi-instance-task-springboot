# bpmn-multi-instance-task

Runs one task once per element of a collection and hands each instance its element, its index
and the total. A delta on top of `module-single`.

## Placeholders

Replace all of these consistently; they are the same in every blueprint.

Blueprint-specific names, each occurring in more than one place:

|               Name                |                                            Where it occurs                                             |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ServiceTask_RequestPartnerOffer` | the ID of the multi-instance element in the BPMN and the value of all three multi-instance annotations |
| `partnerIds`                      | the attribute of the workflow aggregate and the collection expression of the multi-instance element    |
| `partnerId`                       | the element variable of the model and the parameter the handler is given                               |

The value of the annotations is the ID of the multi-instance ELEMENT, not the name of the
element variable. Getting it wrong fails the task while it runs, with a message naming the
contexts the BPMS did supply.

`TestApplication`, `WorkflowModuleTest` and `ApplicationSmokeTest` are identical in every
blueprint - copy them unchanged.

## Adding this blueprint to an existing project

1. Put what is iterated over onto the workflow aggregate, as identifiers rather than objects,
   and let the business code fill it in a task BEFORE the multi-instance one. The collection
   has to exist when the engine reaches the task.
2. Add the multi-instance element to the BPMN and let it read that attribute
   (`camunda:collection="${partnerIds}"` on Camunda 7, `inputCollection="=partnerIds"` on
   Camunda 8). Never push a collection into the process as a variable.
3. Annotate the parameters of the `@WorkflowTask` method with `@MultiInstanceElement`,
   `@MultiInstanceIndex` or `@MultiInstanceTotal`, whichever the business code needs, and give
   each of them **the ID of the multi-instance element**.
4. Write the result of an iteration as a ROW OF ITS OWN, never into an attribute all
   iterations share. Instances run at the same time on a remote engine, each of them saves the
   whole aggregate, and the one committing last would put back what it read at its start.
   Nothing reports that.
5. Put anything computed over all iterations into a task AFTER the multi-instance one. An
   iteration sees one element and cannot know whether it is the last.
6. Keep the number of iterations out of the model. A list in configuration or in the data
   means adding an element is not a deployment.
7. Extend `LoanApprovalIT` with assertions that do not depend on the order of the iterations.
   `containsExactlyInAnyOrder` rather than `containsExactly`, because there is no order.

Nested iterations, a multi-instance task inside a multi-instance subprocess, are what the
`resolverBean` of `@MultiInstanceElement` is for. This blueprint does not need it; the
[SPI documentation](https://github.com/vanillabp/spi-for-java#multi-instance) shows it.

## Verifying

```bash
mvn install verify
```

That runs on Camunda 7, which is embedded and needs no infrastructure. The Camunda 8 adapter
does not supply the multi-instance context yet, so `-Pcamunda8` fails at runtime with
`No multi-instance context named '...' was supplied by the BPMS adapter` - that is a reported
gap of the adapter, not a defect of the generated code.

`LoanApprovalIT` proves the aspect and has to pass: one row per element, the index each
iteration was given, and the result computed after the last of them.

Do not report success without having run this.
