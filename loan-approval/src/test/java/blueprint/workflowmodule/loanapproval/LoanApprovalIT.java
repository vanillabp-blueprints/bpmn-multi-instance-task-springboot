 * The integration test of this workflow module: it starts a real workflow in a real BPMS
 * and waits for every iteration of the multi-instance task to have left its row.
 *
 * <p>
 * The assertions are about the rows, not about the order they appeared in. The instances
 * run at the same time, so anything relying on iteration 0 committing before iteration 1
 * would be a test which passes on one engine and fails on the other.
